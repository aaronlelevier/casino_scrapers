Questions
=========
1. Does ``TextField`` and ``CharField`` have no overhead difference when indexing?

2. Will ``Role`` be translated w/i the database and have multiple ``Role`` records, 
or will it be translated and archived w/i ".js" files?

3. Full text scan w/i PostgreSQL

4. Take a quick look at Capistrano, and check if it's worth looking at, or use 
SaltStack and work with Bill on putting it on the server
